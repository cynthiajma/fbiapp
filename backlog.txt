HIGH PRIORITY - KNOWN ISSUES
================================================================================

1. INVESTIGATION VS LOGGING DATA CLARITY
   Priority: HIGH
   Status: TODO
   Description: The current logging system stores a feeling level for each investigation question.
    This makes it unclear what data represents what.
   
   Proposed Solutions:
   - Option A: Separate investigation data into its own table/field with clear 
               distinction from feeling level logs
   - Option B: Add UI indicators to clearly show the difference between 
               investigation words and feeling level in loggin chart. 
   
   Impact: Affects data clarity for parents viewing child data and may impact 
           data analysis accuracy.
